# zig-mbedtls-example

An Example of using mbedtls with Zig v11

This is a translation of the ssl_server.c example in mbedtls.

https://github.com/Mbed-TLS/mbedtls/blob/development/programs/ssl/ssl_server.c


The src directory contains a single file that has the mbedTLS struct that contains all the functions needed to make a ssl server.

The lib directory has 2 files as zig can't get the size of the mbedtls_ssl_config struct. I took this code from [Ninjacato's zig-mbedtls](https://github.com/ninjacato/zig-mbedtls/tree/master).

The build.zig contains the steps needed to build the project.

The code in this project is an example for me to be able to use mbedtls in my [ScarletDME](https://github.com/Krowemoh/ScarletDME) project. YMMV :)
